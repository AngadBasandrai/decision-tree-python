# Introduction

Binary Decision Tree and Bagged Decision Trees implemented from scratch in Python

# Binary Decision Tree

Given a dataset the goal of the algorithm is to generate a Binary Decision Tree to accurately predict the value of a new example

In each iteration it calculates the entropy using the formula

> **- { x **路** log<sub>2</sub>(x)&nbsp; + &nbsp;(1 - x) **路** log<sub>2</sub>(1 - x) }**
  
where is **x** is the ratio of true cases to total cases

> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_entropy_function">more</a> about this formula and calculation of entropy in Binary Trees

It further calculates information gain, based on which it decides where to split

Information gain is calculated as follows:
> Assume that before splitting entropy was H<sub>root</sub> and there were n elements in total

> Now it splits at some feature and sends a and b elements to the left and right branches respectively, with their entropies being H<sub>left</sub> and H<sub>right</sub>

> gain = H<sub>root</sub> - { [ a/n ] **路** H<sub>left</sub> + [ b/n ] **路** H<sub>right</sub> }

The goal is to maximise gain each iteration and for every branch

# Bagged Decision Trees Algorithm

Given a dataset the goal of the algorithm is to generate a set of 'n' Binary Decision Trees to predict the probability of a new example being true or false

Each Binary Decision Tree is created on a unique dataset generated with sampling with replacement on the original dataset

The generation of the Binary Decision Trees follows the same process as before only with a different dataset
